If you find bugs, have suggestions or any other problems, feel free to
report an issue on the issue tracker or hit me up on IRC, I'm always
on ``#emacs``.  Patches are welcome, too, just fork, work on a
separate branch and open a pull request with it.

Invalid EPUB documents are *not* supported.  Please use epubcheck_ to
validate yours when running into an error.

In case the bug is specific to an EPUB document, please send it to me
via email or upload it on an OCH and share the link with me.  I'll try
my best to figure out the error, but chances are you can figure it out
as well by using the source view (bound to ``v`` for the current
document and ``V`` for the content file) to spot the problematic XML.
